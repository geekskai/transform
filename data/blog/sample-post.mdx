# How to Convert SVG to JSX: The Ultimate 2026 Guide

Converting SVG files to JSX is a fundamental skill for React developers. Whether you're building a design system or just adding icons to a landing page, understanding how to effectively manage SVGs can significantly improve your workflow and application performance.

In this guide, we'll explore the best methods to convert SVGs to JSX, from manual techniques to using powerful automation tools.

## Method 1: The Manual Way (Good for Learning)

You can manually convert SVG attributes to camelCase, which is the standard for JSX props. For example:

- `class` becomes `className`
- `stroke-width` becomes `strokeWidth`
- `fill-rule` becomes `fillRule`

```jsx
// Before (SVG)
<svg class="icon" stroke-width="2">...</svg>

// After (JSX)
<svg className="icon" strokeWidth="2">...</svg>
```

While good for understanding the differences, manual conversion is tedious and error-prone for complex graphics.

## Method 2: Using Online Converters (Fastest)

For quick tasks, using a dedicated tool is the most efficient approach.

**Try our free tool:** [SVG to JSX Converter](/tools/svg-to-jsx)

Simply paste your SVG code, and get clean, optimized JSX ready for your React project. It handles all the attribute conversions and cleanup for you instantly.

## Method 3: Automated CLI Tools (Best for Scale)

If you have a large library of icons, automation is key. Tools like SVGR can be integrated into your build process to transform SVGs into components content automatically.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why should I convert SVG to JSX?

Converting SVG to JSX allows you to use SVGs as standard React components, enabling dynamic styling, easier animation, and better integration with your application's state and props.

### What is the difference between manual conversion and using a tool?

Manual conversion requires changing attributes like 'class' to 'className' and 'stroke-width' to 'strokeWidth'. Tools automate this process, saving time and preventing syntax errors, especially for complex SVGs.

### Can I use external SVG files in React?

Yes, you can import SVGs as React components using bundlers like Webpack or Vite (e.g., `import { ReactComponent as Icon } from './icon.svg'`), but converting them to inline JSX offers more control over their internals.
